This section exists to add complexity to this document, so that we may all learn. It is more topical than goats, but much less entertaining.

## This is a story about Goats

One day, there was a Goat from the Forest that loved cheese. This goat was named Gruff, and he was covered in moss. Brie was his favorite kind of cheese, and he loved to eat it on a nice crisp chunk of tree bark.
